The column indices i.e. second-hand car purchase is similar to buying a second-hand car and car purchase is same as purchase a car. These two indices were combine using replace name method. This was easy to stemm purposes. Afterward the purposes were combined in category columns applying the stemming method as in above function.The values were traced by head and tail function to identify any uncategorize indicies."

    "The aim of the project was to prepare a bank's loan division report. The data consisted of total 12 columns and 21525 no. of rows. After removing the duplicate values. The dataset consist of customers information regarding, children, marital status, level of education, income level and the purpose why they applied for the loan. We have categorize and observe different customers groups depending upon information given. Firstly, in preprocessed the data, missing values, data type,  duplicated values were handled and data was ready for the analysis. \n",

    "In missing values detection step, the column children of dataset there is typo and it seams that 1 and 20 were filled by -1 and 20 mistakenly. We will take absolute of the values to and replace with the actual corresponding value. Total 2174 values were missing in each column of days_employed and total_income. To deal with missing values the median were calculated and fill values afterward. In column of dob_years which represents the age of the customers,total 101 values missing and firstly the data was grouped in reference of the employment type and observed that customers are there are employed type or retiree. With median the age of all retiree and employed people were calculated which were 60 and 39 rexpectively. But some retiree people has age of 54 mentioned in the column so this approach was declined and overall median was calculated and fill values with that. The possible reason which was detected the this age group has mostly college or school level education. The reason for missing value whould be that relationship in very early age but this observation can be rejected on the basis when the customer failed to repay the loan. The relationship of age=0 values were observed with other columns. The mostly people has bachelor or secondary school education. One observation is that the these people are not really belong to one category but randomly distributed in different group of people.So, the possible reason could be that people were not willing to share date of birth or missid by the data entry person. The education columns values were string dtype str.lower method ws applied to remove the duplicate. The column named purchase has different reason for laon but the issue was detected with the description of same purpose in differnt word of choice. For example, car, purchase of car, Purchase of Car etc. represent the same purpose but word of description were different in many cases. A function was developed by categorizing the columns in car, house, eduation, real state and property. \n",
