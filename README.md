Yandex Practicum 100 data analyst program prepares me for a career as a data analyst by helping me learn to clean and organize data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate critical findings. I have developed proficiency in Python and its data analysis libraries (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, Dash), SQL, Power BI, Tableau, HTML, CSS, Google Analytics as I built a portfolio of projects .

Tips: For data science projects with python, I would recomend you to install numpy , pandas , scipy , scikit learn , matplotlib , seaborn basic libraries.
